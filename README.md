**📊 Results & Observations**

Classical machine learning models demonstrated strong performance under
limited data conditions.

Deep learning models showed potential for spatiotemporal representation
learning but were constrained by dataset size and training duration.

A detailed comparative discussion, including performance metrics,
confusion matrices, ROC analysis, and error analysis, is provided in the
final report.

**📝 Notes**

This repository is intended strictly for academic and educational purposes.

Due to size constraints, the full dataset is not included; only dataset
metadata and sample frames are provided.

Experimental results may vary depending on system configuration and library
versions.
